00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,000
You should watch that

21
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,600

22
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,000
- Arin: Yep

23
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,100
- Dan: Oh, is this the one where fuckin Ross wouldn't hit a number?

24
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,700
And everyone was pissed off at him?

25
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,900
- Arin: No, that was, um...

26
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,500

That is, that does

31
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,500
- Arin, interrupting: Although I'm sure something similar happened

32
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,400
in that one as well cause Ross is *literally* the worst

33
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,800
- Dan: Because Ross is Ross

34
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,300

00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,074
Oh fuck!

00:00:50,777 --> 00:00:51,571

- Arin: Two players. The Wii Remote

00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,265
